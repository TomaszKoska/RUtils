TODO:
PCA sometimes gives NA row. It depands on used variables... Why?



1. Functions imputing data start with "imp"
2. Functions removing outliers start with "out"
3. Functions removing redundant variables (reducing dimensions) start with "red"
4. Functions transforming variables start with "tra"
5. Functions adding variables start with "add"
